# HOUSING-PRICE-PREDICTION
Developed a linear regression model to predict housing prices using features like area, bedrooms, and amenities. Converted categorical data to numerical values, trained the model on 80% of the data, and evaluated it with Mean Squared Error. Visualized predictions versus true prices and made predictions on new data.
